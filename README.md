## Why
Everyone can benifit from owning a website and I plan to use this site to try out experimental ideas and platforms that aren't ready for a production build
## How
KwesiThe.Dev[https://kwesithe.dev] will work primarily like a blog site with some libraries included for testing 

### Hosting:
The site will be hosted on Netlify[https://netlify.com] due to its support for the JAMstack (JavaScript, API, Markup) netlify also enable flexability to migrate to a new cloud backend in the future if needed.

### Site Stack
Are websites stacks anymore? Well this one is more like a buffet
I will be writing and publishing blog articles on a headless wordpress instance as a CMS
Front-end UI will be developed here publicly using NEXT.js[https://nextjs.org]
Outside of those two componets I will connect to SendGrid for email management and Twilio for Voice and Text features of the website
I'll be adding new package when I come across something compelling.

### Updates
A seperate bracnh will be created to handle site updates. Content managed by my headless wordpress instance will exist remote and updated and backedup from their. 

## Goal
Be more open and honest online and document my development journey for others to see

## Metrics
"What is measured gets managed" - Some Corporate Executive
But I want to see if I can grow my website traffic and hear from other developers on projects their working on an provide support where I can.

### Organic Traffic
I will include a Google Analytics API to track site visits and behavior so see if my stories are compelling and see if particular articles are driving traffic of a social media channel directing people to the home page.

### Post Frequency
While Organic Growth is great I will have to stay consitistent to build my voice online so I will also prioritize how often I am posting on my blog.
